# Sr-AMM - Should be called DLMM(Tenetative)

Sandwich-Resistant Automated Market Maker (Sr-AMM) with dynamic fees. This combination should address both MEV issues and help mitigate LVR(DLMM). Here's a conceptual design:
1. Sr-AMM Core Mechanism:
   * Implement the Sr-AMM design as described in the "Sandwich-Resistant AMM" document:
      * Operate on slot windows (e.g., 4 slots on Solana, 1 on Ethereum).
      * Within a slot window, buys increase the offer price but keep the bid price constant.
      * Sells decrease the offer price but keep the bid price constant.
      * Reset the state to the equivalent xy=k state at the beginning of each slot window.
2. Dynamic Fee Structure:
   * Implement a fee model that adjusts based on market conditions:
      * Base fee: Start with a low base fee (e.g., 0.05%).
      * Volatility adjustment: Increase fees during high volatility periods.
      * Volume adjustment: Adjust fees based on recent trading volume.
      * Liquidity depth adjustment: Higher fees when liquidity is thin.
3. Fee Calculation Algorithm:
   * Fee = BaseFee + VolatilityFactor + VolumeFactor + LiquidityFactor
   * VolatilityFactor = f(price change over last N blocks)
   * VolumeFactor = g(trading volume over last M blocks)
   * LiquidityFactor = h(current liquidity depth)
   * Where f, g, and h are carefully calibrated functions.
4. Fee Update Mechanism:
   * Update fees at the beginning of each slot window.
   * Implement a maximum fee change per update to prevent drastic swings.
   * Use a moving average for smoother transitions.
5. Price Oracle Integration:
   * Use Time-Weighted Average Price (TWAP) to smooth out short-term fluctuations.(needed?)
6. Liquidity Provider Incentives:
   * Distribute a portion of the collected fees to LPs based on their share of the pool.
   * Implement a bonus structure for LPs who maintain their positions during high-volatility periods.
7. MEV Mitigation:
   * Leverage the Sr-AMM design to prevent atomic sandwich attacks.
   * Implement a minimum time delay between trades from the same address to further deter MEV.
8. Gas Optimization:
   * Optimize the fee calculation and update process to minimize gas costs.
   * Consider implementing batch updates for multiple pools if applicable.
9. User Interface:
   * Provide clear, real-time information about current fees and how they're calculated.
   * Offer predictive tools to help users estimate fees for upcoming trades.
11. Governance and Parameter Adjustment: ## I don't know why this is important but my co-founder claude thinks it is
   * Allow for community governance to adjust key parameters like BaseFee or the functions f, g, and h.
   * Implement a timelock for parameter changes to ensure transparency.
12. Safety Measures: # will see how Meteora does theirs but this what I thought of
   * Create a fee cap to prevent potential exploitation of the dynamic fee system.
Implementation Goals:
* Carefully test the interaction between the Sr-AMM mechanism and the dynamic fee structure.
* Ensure that the fee calculation is deterministic and can be predicted by users before they submit transactions.
* Consider the impact of the slot window reset on the dynamic fee calculation.
* Optimize the code to ensure that the added complexity doesn't significantly increase gas costs or introduce vulnerabilities.
This design combines the MEV resistance of the Sr-AMM with the adaptability of dynamic fees, potentially creating a more efficient and fair trading environment. The dynamic fees should help address LVR by adjusting to market conditions, while the Sr-AMM structure mitigates sandwich attacks and other forms of MEV.
